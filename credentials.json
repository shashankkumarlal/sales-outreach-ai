## Why Do You Need `credentials.json`?

The `credentials.json` file contains your Google API OAuth 2.0 credentials.  
It is required to securely authenticate your app with Google servicesâ€”specifically the Gmail API in this project.  

This allows the Sales Outreach AI Agent to:
- Access your Gmail account to **read incoming emails** (like replies from leads)
- Send emails programmatically on your behalf  
- Manage your email data without exposing your password  
- Maintain secure, authorized communication with Google services  

Without this file, your agent cannot connect to Gmail API or perform automated email reading and sending.
